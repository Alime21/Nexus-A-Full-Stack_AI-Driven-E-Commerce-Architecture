# Nexus-A-Full-Stack_AI-Driven-E-Commerce-Architecture
An end-to-end, containerized e-commerce architecture. Integrates a modern frontend, scalable microservices, cloud deployment, and a machine learning engine for real-time customer churn prediction.

---------------------
## About The Project:

Nexus is a comprehensive, scalable e-commerce platform designed to demonstrate end-to-end system engineering. Going beyond basic CRUD operations, this project integrates a robust polyglot persistence backend, a responsive user interface, and cloud-native infrastructure.

At its core lies an intelligent data science engine, leveraging predictive models (such as Random Forest and GBM) to analyze customer behavior and proactively prevent churn. Developed with a strong focus on pragmatic, clean code principles, the entire architecture is containerized using Docker and orchestrated for seamless cloud deployment. It serves as a blueprint for bridging the gap between software development, data science, and cloud operations.
